# Tech-Reads

It is a game and tech review application that allows a user to read or watch game reviews from multiple sources and the application should give an average rating based on the source ratings as well as see the some of the latest tech news that the sources have. The application is ment to be used at the users convenience such as while having breakfast or even a relaxing read (you dont even have to do any searching as the application would show suggested stories based on the users preferences) before bed and without the hassle of searching multiple sources to see if the game reviews are accurate. The application will request 2 of the users preferences (console preferences and favourite genre of games) and the answers are saved on the device to be used by the application to give the user more relevant information.
